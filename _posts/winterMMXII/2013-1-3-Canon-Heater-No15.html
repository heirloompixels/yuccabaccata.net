<h1>Canon Heater No. 15</h1>
<p>The harbinger of warmth.</p>
<p>Our house has as few machines as possible.  We grind coffee my hand.  We slice food with a knife.  We sweep the floors.  We burn wood to stay warm.  Mr. Cannon is where we burn that wood.</p>

<p>Mr. Cannon is a relic from the past, a piece of ancient technology unlike anything which is made today.  It's heavy, as in, it takes three people to move it.  But this weight is what give it such presence and piece of mind.  This stove will handle any wood that I throw at it.</p>

<p>
  The heat from Mr. Canon:  intense and yet so tender to the cold body.  It's like the sun in the solar system, up close you are on fire but far way it's icy cold - last night a pipe froze ever so slightly in the kitchen. It allows us the escape from the cold but you never forget it's there, you never forget what time of year it is.  You get, in fact, to experiencew the cold fully.  I know for sure that it is winter out there as the warmth modulates to the input of wood.

<p>Life with a stove is very deliberate.  You must take action before you will get heat.  There is no thermostat.  There is no temperature control, no comfort zones.  Everything is an action from stoking the wood to setting the draghts to banking the fire for those long slow burns.  An old stove like Mr. Cannon only exagerates these tasks.</p>

<p>This deliberate life is the key to what we are trying to do: it is our intention to impose constraints on the way we live so that we might feel life a little bit more.  The shift between seasons is a paramount characteristic of earth but far too many people experience this in climate control instead of with vivid sensation.  At it's most basic a connection with the seasons seems to have a profound impact on the psychy - what this impact results in is the essence of our investigation.</p>
