<h1>Nomad + Explorer + Artist</h1>

<p>The banana yucca: Y. baccata.  The Datil Yucca.  I don't actually know it, as in, i've never identified it yet.  But I will and i'll be eating it this summer.</p>

<p>I became obsessed with the name it's been going through my mind for the last half a year since a friend first told me about it.  He had gathered a few fruits to save the seeds and start growing them at his farm - as he taught me you can never have enough diversity of food plants and droubt tollarance in the desert.<p>

<p>And this name kept wandering around my brain. And the name Yucca Baccata started to take on the personaility of this project.  It all is being cooked in my head at the same time so natually the flavors meld together and become one.  This, though, is the first time I'm actually getting around to documenting the endeavors as they happen.  It's also the most developed project, that is, i've thought lond and hard about the philosophical side of the undertaking and what it is we are trying to communicate.</p>

<p>Right, ultimately art is communication, the different mediums speaking to different subtitlties within our soul.  It's good then to have a framework of exploration going into this project, it might be a maturing of sorts.</p>

The big question is who are you and what do you express.  This changes, at least if you let it change.  And these changes are particularily, and what casues these changes.  What influences us.  See if we start to apply constraints to our living.

Not "rules" but constraints.  Like handweaving.  Using a loom to make art, to make a living, and to make the things we use.  This does interesting things to your way of seeing the world and to your interaction of the world.  It changes what you make.  

And at our core we are cave men.  The rock paintings are so loved and so awe inspiring because the resonate with us at a level we don't often allow ourselves to explore.  We can't becuase of the way we live.  But by living like a cave man we can feel it again.  The awe of the world.  The big interesting question is what would i make if i went a lived like a nomad in the wilderness.  How would hunting for rabits with a homemade bow change the way i express myself.  What would i express.  What could i unlock in my ancient self, those archtypes. 

Oh and always, yes, would it even be interesting?  You've got to try to find out. 

It's all encompassing though, i've got to make my tools and my clothes as well, and at home i've got to live as simply as possible so that it's easier to drop into the cave man psyche.  

<p>The idea here is to see what you make when you live as simply as possible.  There are different degrees of simple-all of those being explored.  Two sides of the coin exist: the homestead and technological side which is explored at <a href="homemadespaceship.net">Homemade Spaceship</a> and the artistic and psychological side which is explored here.</p>

<p>The ultimate question is what would you make if you went and lived in the forest like the past.  In the pursuit of this you realize that all constraints produce amazing results - the combinations like ingrediants of the chef or the colors of the plein air man.  Along the way you must explore the chromatic variations of technology through the ages and see how they affect artistic output.</p>
<p>And the onion peels - now the question is how you feel.  How you behave.  What is happiness here. What can I learn?  How do i communicate this to someone, anyone, to you?  Visually, verbaly, Diagramatically, Intuitively or Gesturally.  Where does the encyclopedia end and where does the poetry begin?</p>
<p>In the end these constraints produce the real time traveler and that age old issue arrises of how can we span time?<p>
